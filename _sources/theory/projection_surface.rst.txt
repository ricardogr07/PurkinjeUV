Projection to the Heart Surface
===============================

Summary
-------

Instead of advancing branches directly on a curved 3D endocardial surface, we grow the network
in a parameter space (a 2D plane or a locally flattened chart) and then **project** each new point
back to the endocardium. This greatly improves robustness on highly curved or irregular meshes and
keeps growth tangential to the surface.

Why not grow directly in 3D?
----------------------------

Direct 3D stepping tends to:
- drift off-surface due to accumulated numeric error,
- get trapped by highly acute triangles or noisy normals,
- produce gaps in coverage on thin or tightly curved regions.

Projection pipeline
-------------------

1. **Propose a 2D step**
   Advance the branch tip in the parameter space using the 2D growth rule
   (see :doc:`fundamentals_2d` for the discrete update).

2. **Map 2D → 3D candidate**
   If a UV mesh is available, map the 2D point to an initial 3D candidate.
   Otherwise, use the last 3D tip and the proposed direction to form a small 3D offset.

3. **Pre-project along the vertex normal (optional but recommended)**
   From the candidate point, move a short distance along the local vertex normal
   to reduce penetration or hovering.

4. **Snap to the surface**
   Use a triangle locator (VTK cell locator / nearest‐triangle search) to project the point
   onto the closest triangle; clamp barycentric coordinates to ensure the point sits on the
   triangle and not outside its edges.

5. **Validate and accept**
   - Enforce minimum spacing using :class:`purkinje_uv.nodes.Nodes.collision`.
   - If the point violates spacing or leaves the manifold, reduce the step (``l_segment``) and retry.
   - On repeated failure, terminate the branch (creates an end node).

Implementation mapping
----------------------

- :class:`purkinje_uv.mesh.Mesh`
  - ``project_new_point(candidate)`` – snaps a 3D candidate to the closest triangle.
  - ``gradient(p)`` – returns a surface gradient used to steer growth (tangent guidance).
  - ``detect_boundary()`` – marks boundary edges (useful for seeding/constraints).
  - ``compute_uvscaling()`` – builds/validates UVs and scaling for parameter‐space steps.

- :class:`purkinje_uv.fractal_tree_uv.FractalTree`
  - owns ``mesh`` (3D), optionally ``mesh_uv`` (2D chart), and the triangle locator,
  - calls ``grow_tree()`` which advances branches, projects new nodes, and appends edges.

- :class:`purkinje_uv.branch.Branch`
  - computes the next step in parameter space and requests surface projection,
  - consults :class:`purkinje_uv.nodes.Nodes` for collision checks.

Robustness tips
---------------

- **Keep steps small**: ``l_segment`` too large leads to overshoot on high curvature.
- **Use normals sparingly**: a short pre-projection along the vertex normal reduces artifacts,
  but long moves can cross cavities on thin walls.
- **Rebuild collision tree**: call ``Nodes.update_collision_tree()`` after batches of insertions.
- **Clamp UV steps**: when using UV charts, prevent long jumps across seams.

Quality checks
--------------

- **Surface adherence**: the dot product between triangle normal and the vector from the
  triangle plane to the new point should be ≈ 0 (within tolerance).
- **Coverage**: compute the maximum distance from endocardial surface samples to the nearest
  network node; trend this metric while tuning parameters.
- **Degree sanity**: endpoints must be degree-1 in the generated connectivity.

Minimal example
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   from purkinje_uv import Parameters, Mesh, FractalTree

   p = Parameters()
   mesh = Mesh.from_file("endocardium.vtu")
   mesh.detect_boundary()
   mesh.compute_uvscaling()  # optional if UVs are present

   ft = FractalTree(mesh=mesh, params=p, mesh_uv=mesh)  # use a separate UV mesh if available
   ft.grow_tree()  # projection happens internally
