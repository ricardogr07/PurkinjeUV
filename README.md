# PurkinjeUV

`PurkinjeUV` is a modular Python package for constructing, simulating, and exporting fractal-based Purkinje networks on cardiac surface meshes. It supports UV mapping, mesh processing, eikonal activation via FIM solvers, and VTK/IGB file utilities.

## Features

- Fractal-based generation of Purkinje networks over UV-projected surface meshes
- Eikonal activation modeling using fast iterative methods (FIM)
- Surface mesh handling and Laplacian-based UV mapping
- IGB-to-VTK volumetric data conversion and boundary surface extraction

## Installation

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install purkinje-uv
